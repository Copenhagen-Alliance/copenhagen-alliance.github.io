- Software platforms for working with biblical texts (translation, annotation, queries, research, etc.)
- Images of manuscripts
- Transcriptions of manuscripts
- Critical editions of biblical texts
- Morphologies
- Syntactic analyses
- Headings and passage boundaries
- Word senses
- Glosses
- Discourse analyses
- Semantic analyses
- Alignment data for manuscripts and critical editions
- Lexicons
- Semantic domains and WordNets
- Reference grammars
- Commentaries
- Translation handbooks and guides
- Exegetical summaries
- Catalogues of specific kinds of references - people, places, things, flora, fauna, etc.
- Catalogues of specific figures of speech and rhetorical devices
- Catalogues of specific syntactic structures, e.g. articular infinitives, articular participles, circumstantial participles, supplementary participles, etc.
- Cross-reference tables for versification across manuscripts and critical editions
- Maps and GIS coordinates
