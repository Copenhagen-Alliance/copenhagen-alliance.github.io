# Curating resources	

Resources should be curated over time, correcting errors, adding new features, and responding to the needs of the community.	
	
We prefer resources that are available in publicly accessible source code control systems like GitHub. These systems make it much easier for communities to access data, suggest corrections by opening issues, compare current versions to previous versions to see what changed, and to work together to add new features in branches.
