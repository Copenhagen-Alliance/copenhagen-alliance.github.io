We are designing a community process to develop standards for interoperability in digital biblical humanities. This repository will contain both:

1. Documents that describe the standardization process, and
2. Standards documents developed by the community

We will use issues against this repository to track issues against both the process documents and the standards documents.  Discuss documents or issues in https://biblicalhumanities.slack.com/messages/standards.

Examples of standards we may choose to develop:

1. Standards for referring to books, chapters, verses, words, characters, etc., probably leveraging OSIS identifiers and CTS URIs.  This would enable cross-reference and annotation among diverse resources.
2. Exchange formats for texts, morphologies, and treebanks.  This would simplify coordination among texts derived from each other.
3. Best practices for licensing and source code control.
