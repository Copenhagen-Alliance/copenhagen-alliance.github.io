#  Copenhagen Alliance for Open Biblical Language Resources

The Copenhagen Alliance for Open Biblical Language Resources is a diverse coalition of organizations, institutions, and individuals with a common interest in making biblical language data free and openly accessible to anyone for research, language learning, translation, and other uses.

We formed this coalition at a workshop for researchers, language teachers, and translators in Copenhagen in March, 2018.  As we worked together, we realized that freely licensed resources would make it possible for us to work together to accomplish much more than any one group can. Some groups are blocked because they cannot use resources that other groups have. Several groups are creating similar resources because they are unaware of the work of other groups or because licensing restrictions prevent their use. This duplicate effort is inefficient.  Worse, many of these projects are not finished because of insufficient resources, or never achieve the level of quality that could be achieved if we pooled our effort.  We decided to form a coalition to identify existing resources, promote free licensing for existing resources that can be shared, and create new resources.

Some resources are created only for commercial use or cannot be freely licensed for other reasons.  We recognize that fact, and some of our members produce such resources. Our focus is on resources that can be freely licensed.

## What do we mean by free?

## What do we mean by openly accessible?

## What kinds of resources are we targeting?
