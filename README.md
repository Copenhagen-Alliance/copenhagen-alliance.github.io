We are designing a community process to develop standards for interoperability in digital biblical humanities. This repository will contain both:

1. Documents that describe the standardization process, and
2. Standards documents developed by the community

We will use issues against this repository to track issues against both the process documents and the standards documents.  Discuss documents or issues in https://biblicalhumanities.slack.com/messages/standards.
