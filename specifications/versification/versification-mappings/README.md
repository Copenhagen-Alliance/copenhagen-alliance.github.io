# Copenhagen Alliance Versification Mappings

This directory contains files for a versification format derived from the VRS versification files used in Paratext.

It contains:

1. `json-schema` - A JSON Schema that defines the format.
2. `standard-mappings` - A base versification file (`org.json`) and sample versification files that describe the versification of some well-known Scriptures.
3. `sample-custom-mappings` - Examples of custom mappings, illustrating how the format can be used.
