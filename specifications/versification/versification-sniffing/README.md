## Copenhagen Alliance Versification Sniffing

**Versification sniffing** refers to applying a set of rules to a Scripture text in order to identify its versification.

The Versification Working Group will provide the following:

1. Rules for Versification - a set of rules, expressed in JSON, to identify the versification scheme used in a given Scripture text.
2. Documention describing the format for these rules and how to use them.
3. Sample code for identifying the versification scheme for a text.
